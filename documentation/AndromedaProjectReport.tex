\section{Introduction}
This document contains information on SchedEx, an examination-venue scheduling software to be implemented into university/college institutions. This includes the requirements specification which is composed of the project scope, product description, formal requirements definition and use cases. The system design comprises the domain model, informal description, system use cases and system framework. The system implementation contains the dependencies, testing and pair work as well as the presentation, business and data layers.

\subsection{Project Overview}
A class-examination to venue scheduling system software is required to be implemented to aid university/college institutions.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
We want our examination Time-table scheduling software to allocate examinations to venues on the recommended date-time slot (if possible), maximising student-venue capacity and minimising examination clashes.

Recommended date-time slots may be the same for different examinations. If this is ignored when generating the time-table then examination clashes can be made resulting in an unorganised timetable and overbooked venue.

Separate venues will have to be allocated to clashing recommended date-time slots and should be ignored when it is not possible to assign that examination to the recommended date-time slot. We will use a graph colouring algorithm to minimise examination-venue clashes.

\subsection{Project Objectives}
The system will need to produce a clash free examination time-table, taking the following into consideration for each course:
\begin{itemize}
\item Recommended examination date-time slot
\item Number of students registered
\item Current venue where lectures take place
\item Main buildings where the faculties of the courses are located
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Stakeholders}
The following is a list of stakeholders:
\begin{itemize}
\item Students
\item Lecturers
\item Course Coordinators
\item Administrators
\item University Management
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements Specification}
\subsection{Project Scope}

The project scope is based around implementing a software system to schedule class-examination to examination venues. The system will take into consideration details such as class size, preferred examination date and time when scheduling the examination and venue. Once a examination timetable is generated students and lecturers will be provided with a personalised version of the timetable consisting of just the courses he/she is associated with. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a robust examination scheduling software to be used by tertiary education facilities with minimum examination clashes. If an examination clash occurs then the relevant personnel will be notified and will be corrected manually.

This project contributes to the need for an examination scheduling solution that's capable of generating an optimal timetable with minimal clashes and as accommodating as possible for the various course combinations for students and lecturers alike.

The purpose of the project (i.e. exam scheduling) has the expectation of ensuring that each set of exams at a tertiary (or other similar) institution has a minimal amount of clashes and fair spread of a degree's exams across the examination period (i.e. a student won't have a situation where they'll have to write all 4 of their exams in a week given the examination period is four weeks)

The goals of the project include the creation of a web application that optimises the exam scheduling process and reports to the system actors with meaningful information, creating the system in such a manner that it is aligned with the client's requirements (functionality), making a robust and reliable system, meeting phase deadlines, planning thoroughly according to the SDLC and operating cohesively as an organisation to provide the requested product.

The deliverables of the project include the fully functional web application in the allocated time frame, documents detailing the various phases of the project (including iterations) which will provide the foundation for the final product, presentations which will provide user-centric information to the clients and proof of concept and feasibility of the project, detailing and implementing the many requirements of the project (including but not limited to the mechanical data processing requirements i.e. identifying and getting the business processes and work-flows up and running, and reporting requirements) which will lead to a successful system.

The project is time sensitive and, as such, should be completed before the required deadline. This will be achieved by using an Agile approach to the Software Development Life Cycle, specifically, the SCRUM methodology. This will ensure that each phase of the project gets the required attention leading to a project of high standards which is complete and considered.

Andromeda hopes to provide a robust platform that will ease the process of exam scheduling and be a useful solution for tertiary institutions.

\subsection{Product Description}

The SchedEx examination scheduling system is designed to schedule examinations for various college/university courses in various venues and time slots without clashes (if possible) whilst taking certain optimisations into account.

\subsubsection{User characteristics}

The following text mentions the purpose of the system for each type of user that's identified to interact with the system:

\textbf{Student} \\
The system creates a clash-free timetable (if possible) and allows the student to view the full timetable as well as a personalised calendar version. If the system is unable to create a clash-free timetable for the student, he/she is notified and is able to see the relevant clash(es).

\textbf{Lecturer} \\
The system creates a clash-free timetable (if possible) and allows the lecturer to view the full timetable as well as a personalised calendar version. If the system is unable to create a clash-free timetable for the lecturer (regarding the courses he/she lectures), he/she is notified and is able to see the relevant clash(es).

\textbf{Course coordinator} \\
The system allows the course coordinator to enter a preference for when and where they wish their exam to be scheduled. The system creates a clash-free timetable (if possible), taking these preferences into account and allows the course coordinator to view the finalised timetable as well as a report on clashes if any are present.

\textbf{Administrator} \\
The system allows the administrator to generate the provisional and final timetable on demand, let's them view the timetable and gives them the ability to edit or create course preference (for the course's exam) on behalf of a lecturer.

\subsection{Formal Requirements Definition}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

The various tables below will list and describe the requirements as understood by Andromeda. Each table will list various requirements (grouped by category), each followed by columns that classify the requirement as either Functional (\textbf{F} - core functionality that is integral to the system) or Non-functional (\textbf{NF} - the methods in which the core functionality will be delivered) as well as either Mandatory (\textbf{M} - requirements key to project success) or Optional (\textbf{O} - requirements that are not necessarily key to a successful project but may improve on or add to the final product) – in the case of functional requirements.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

The list below contains some constraints (or limitations) that affect the system:

\begin{itemize}
\item The system has access to the institutions personnel and student databases - students, course coordinators/lecturers and administrators do not have to register in order to use the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

The list below contains some functionalities that the system depends on:

\begin{itemize}
\item A valid course listing/database with related courses (i.e. courses that can be done simultaneously) clearly indicated - the number of clashes which the system should minimise and generation of a timetable is dependent on this.
\item Internet connection - the system is based on a client-server architecture with the server being centralised and remote.
\item Google Calendar API - if the API drastically changes, the system won't be able to add exam events for students, lecturers and course coordinators.
\item Python networkx - this package is used to graph the required data to generate the examination-venue timetable.
\item Python sqlite3 - this library is used to interact with the institution's database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Operating Environment}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Architecture}: web-based application (client-server) - three-tier
\item \textbf{Operating System}: Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS - any OS wherein a web browser can be used since a web application is being developed
\item \textbf{Database}: SQLite database
\item \textbf{Database Type}: centralised
\item \textbf{Platform}: Python/Javascript/HTML/CSS - used to develop a web app to be accessed through a web browser
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Management}

Data management details how the input and output of the system will be stored. The majority of the data relating to the operation of the SchedEx system will be stored in a relational database. The details of the staff and students are stored in the database of the institution at which the system is being used. The data which is received and generated by the SchedEx system (e.g. course preferences and timetables) is also stored in a database and is received using the business layer of the three-tiered web application.

\subsubsection{Portability}

The system should be able to run on any platform with a web browser.

\subsection{Use Cases}

\subsubsection{Use Case Set}

The list below represents the project Use Case Set identified for the system. The Use Cases are grouped by the business features that they are related to (core, maintenance, reporting and archiving) because this will help with administration purposes. For example, if a new use case has to be added due to system improvements or changes then it will be easier to see where it fits in.

\textbf{Core business-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item Create Timetable
\item Create Course Preference
\item Read Lecturer Timetable
\item Read Student Timetable 
\item Read Timetable
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Maintenance-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, nosep]
\item Update Timetable
\item Update Course Preference
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Reporting-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, nosep]
\item Create Clash Report
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Archiving-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, nosep]
\item Archive Timetable
\end{enumerate}

Actors identified that will link to the Use Case Set include: Student, Lecturer, Course coordinator and Administrator


\subsubsection{Use Case Description}

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}

\item \textbf{Create Timetable} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The administrator clicks the “Generate Timetable” button. The system utilises our scheduling algorithm to match courses and venues with non-conflicting examination slots. The system stores the generated timetable. Thereafter, the system proceeds to create a personalised timetable for each student by creating entries in the respective student's Google Calendar (linked to their student email account). \\
\textbf{Alternate Flow}: If the algorithm is unable to create a clash-free timetable, the best possible timetable is created, a clash report is logged in the database and the administrators and affected students receive an email containing a clash report.

\item \textbf{Create Course Preference} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The course coordinator clicks the “Create Preference” button. The system receives and stores input from the course coordinator on date, time, class size, lecture venue, faculty building.

\item \textbf{Read Lecturer Timetable} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The lecturer’s personalised timetable is retrieved from his/her exam related events that were added to his/her Google calendar (associated with his/her university account) and displayed. Navigation to the exam venue for a selected course is displayed beneath. \\
\textbf{Alternate Flow}: If the exam timetable (provisional or final) hasn’t been created yet then a personalised timetable will be irrelevant and text notifying the lecturer of this will be displayed instead.

\item \textbf{Read Student Timetable} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The student’s personalised timetable is retrieved from his/her exam related events that were added to his/her Google calendar (associated with his/her university account) and displayed. Navigation to the exam venue for a selected course is displayed beneath. \\
\textbf{Alternate Flow}: If the exam timetable (provisional or final) hasn’t been created yet then a personalised timetable will be irrelevant and text notifying the student of this will be displayed instead.

\item \textbf{Read Timetable} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The administrator logs in or the student, lecturer and course coordinator requests to view the full timetable. The stored timetable in the database is then displayed in a friendly format (list or a calendar). Navigation to the exam venue for a selected course is displayed beneath. \\
\textbf{Alternate Flow}: If the exam timetable (provisional or final) hasn’t been created yet then a personalised timetable will be irrelevant and text notifying the admin, student, lecturer or coordinator of this will be displayed instead.

\item \textbf{Update Timetable} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: When a new Course Preference is created the Update Timetable use case is invoked for the algorithm to take into account the new course preference. 

\item \textbf{Update Course Preference} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The course coordinator or admin clicks the “Update Preference” button. The system receives, searches and then updates the relevant course preference. \\
\textbf{Alternate Flow}: If the course coordinator or admin tries to update the course preference of a course that doesn’t have any preferences set, the Create Course Preference use case is invoked.

\item \textbf{Create Clash Report} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The administrator clicks the “Generate Timetable” button which creates the timetable. A report of clashes is then generated and displayed to the administrator as well as emailed to the students and lecturers associated with the courses. \\
\textbf{Alternate Flow}: If there are no clashes one the timetable has been created, the administrator is informed of this through the system.

\item \textbf{Archive Timetable} \\
\textbf{Basic Flow}: The admin clicks the “Generate Timetable” button. The Create Timetable use case is then invoked. The timetable is then archived by storing the dates, times and venues for each course in the database.

\end{enumerate}

\section{System Design}
The design for the system is provided below. The first sub-section includes UML-based logical models
whilst the second explains the design and gives specific details about each of the major components.

\subsection{Domain Model}

\subsubsection{Informal Description}

A system for the scheduling of university or college examinations is to be designed and created. The system is meant to create an exam timetable (optimally) by assigning course exams to a certain venue at a specific time, without creating clashes in the process. The system should function as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Administrators are able to login, specify start and end dates of the examination period, generate a timetable and view the generated timetable.
  \item Course co-ordinators are able to login, enter preferences relating to the scheduling of their courses' exam/s and view the final timetable.
  \item Students and lecturers are able to login to the system and view the full timetable. Additionally, students are able to view a personalised timetable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Use Cases}
The system use cases represent the various scenarios (user stories) which occur during the use of the system.

\subsubsection{Final Use Case List}
The list below represents the final project Use Case Set identified from the Requirements Specification (Section 2.4, above). The Use Cases are grouped by the business features that they are related to (core, maintenance, reporting and archiving) because this will help with administration purposes. 

\textbf{Core business-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item Create Timetable
\item Create Course Preference
\item Read Lecturer Timetable
\item Read Student Timetable 
\item Read Timetable
\item Search Course
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Maintenance-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, nosep]
\item Update Timetable
\item Update Course Preference
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Reporting-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, nosep]
\item Create Clash Report
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Archiving-related use cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[resume, nosep]
\item Archive Timetable
\end{enumerate}

Actors identified that will link to the Use Case Set include: Student, Lecturer, Course co-ordinator and Administrator

\subsubsection{Use Case Diagram}

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{UseCaseDiagram}} 

Figure <x>: Final System Use Case Diagram

The primary actors in this system are the Administrator, Course co-ordinator and Student whilst the Lecturer is a secondary actor. 

The administrator may invoke the Create Timetable use case in order to generate a new timetable or the Update Timetable Use Case in order to update the timetable. Additionally, the administrator may invoke the Create Clash Report use case to generate a list of clashes (if any) and email the affected parties. Finally, the Archive Timetable may be invoked by the administrator in order to archive a previously-generated timetable.

The course co-ordinator is able to invoke the Create Course Preference use case which allows him/her to enter the chosen preferences (date, time and venue) relating to one of their courses.

Students and lecturers invoke the Read Student Timetable and Read Lecturer Timetable use cases respectively to view their personalised timetables based on the courses they take/lecture.

All users (actors) are able to invoke the Read Timetable use case which allows them to view the full timetable (for the whole exam period) which has been generated. Additionally, all users may invoke the Search Course use case which enables them to see the exam details of the course which they have entered.

\subsection{System Framework}
The design is split up into three distinct sections, namely the Presentation, Business and Data Layers: 

\subsubsection{Presentation Layer}
The presentation layer involves the user interface of the application which will run on the client side of the system. It is the front end with which the user
interacts and all transfer of data between the application and the user occurs in this layer. [<x>]

The User Interface is designed to be clean, informative and aesthetically pleasing. There is a logical flow
between screens which ensures that the user always knows where they are currently in the execution of
the program and where they can get to from that state.

With the above in mind, the interface has four screens: Login, Generic (for students and lecturers), Admin and Coordinator.

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{login}} 

Figure <x>: 

The Login screen enables the user to securely login to the system and, after valid credentials have been entered and the login button is clicked,  displays the appropriate screen (Generic, Admin or Coordinator) based on the privilege level of the user - determined by role level in the data layer (Section 3.3.3) associated with the credentials entered.   

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{generic_full}}

Figure <xa)>: Generic screen, full view

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{generic_personalised}}

Figure <xb)>: Generic screen, personalised view

The Generic screen is designed for students and lecturers. The screen facilitates the viewing of the various timetables (both the full timetable, as well as a personalised version). The screen also allows the user to search for a specific course and displays the exam details associated with it.

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{admin_full}}

Figure <xa)>: Admin screen, full timetable view

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{admin_generate}}

Figure <xb)>: Admin screen, generate timetable view 

The Admin screen is designed for university/college administrators. It enables the admin to generate a new timetable through provision of start date and end date fields for the exam period. Additionally, the screen provides the administrator with the option of viewing the generated timetable and editing it, should it prove necessary. 

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{coordinator_full}}

Figure <xa)>: Coordinator screen, full timetable view

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{coordinator_personalised}}

Figure <xb)>: Coordinator screen, personalised view

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{coordinator_course}}

Figure <xb)>: Coordinator screen, preferences view

The Coordinator screen is designed for course co-ordinators. The ability to add course preferences (such as the time, date and venue where they wish their exam to be scheduled) is provided by this part of the interface, along with the option to view the full timetable and a personalised timetable (based on the courses for which he/she is a co-ordinator).

As can be seen from the above screen designs and their associated descriptions, the presentation layer of SchedEx follows a simple, clean methodology which facilitates ease-of-use whilst still providing all of the requested functional and non-functional capabilities of the system.

\subsubsection{Business Layer}
The business layer is where the functionality of the application is implemented and runs on the server side of the system. It acts as the middle-ground between the presentation and data layers – data is received, processed and sent to or from both the presentation and data layers.

The system is designed with the important principles of user experience in mind including: ease-of-use, practicality and efficiency.

The business layer is set to work as follows: data is received from the presentation layer indicating the specific function which the user is requesting. This data, along with the appropriate class and method are used to retrieve (from the data layer) or generate the requested data and process it as necessary before returning it to the presentation layer to be displayed to the user.

Object orientation is to be used in the implementation of the business layer in order to create an accurate representation of the 'real-life' scenario. The exact details of this object oriented design may be found in the class diagram below (Section 3.3.4). Each of the relevant entities in the scenario are modelled as a class with variables and methods which enable them to perform their specific task.

The design of the system ensures the various use cases may be executed intuitively. Each request made from the presentation layer is carried out in a well-defined manner using the aforementioned object oriented approach and returns the correct information to successfully complete the request.

The business layer connects to the data layer through one of the classes. This class contains all of the methods necessary to retrieve any data which made be needed for the processing of requests. In this way, an instance of this class may be made and used wherever communication with the data layer is needed.

\subsubsection{Data Layer}
The data layer acts as the interface with external data storage systems and is stored on the server side of the system. It allows data to be written and
retrieved to and from files and other external systems such as databases.

When designing the data layer, it is important to consider, amongst other things, which attributes should be
stored and the security this data requires. As per the assumptions made in the Requirements Specifications (Section 2.3.2), the system has access to the institution's data stores in order to obtain various student and course-relate data. In addition to this, the system requires its own data stores to act as persistent storage for various aspects of the exam scheduling system.

With the above in mind, the data layer is to be implemented in the form of a database which will maintain all of the relevant attributes. The chosen type of database is relational due to the flexibility it provides, along with security and ease-of-access using SQL querying.

The data layer interacts with the business layer using the intermediary class (as mentioned in the design of the business layer, above). The class makes use of custom SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data from the database tables. The design of the data layer allows this data to be pulled and used in an efficient manner.

\subsubsection{Class Diagram}

In object-oriented programming the code is implemented as a set of classes. The final step in object-
oriented design is to produce a class diagram, which is the detailed description of the code to be produced.
The class diagram shows all of the classes in the application, including their associated attributes and
methods. The class diagram also shows the relationships (association) between classes.
\bigskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{ClassDiagram}}
Figure <x>: Final System Class Diagram

The figure above represents the design of the system (specifically the business layer) and shows the various classes in the object oriented design.

As can be seen, the dbInterface and Timetable classes make up the backbone of the system. The dbInterface class is used to connect to the database - the intermediary class discussed in the design of the business and data layers (Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3) - and creates Course (university courses), Venue (university venues) and Edge (combinations of dates and venues used in graph colouring) objects by pulling the relevant data from the database through an established connection. The Timetable class is the key component in the functioning of the back end. It uses an instance of the dbInterface class to retrieve the necessary data. Thereafter, this data is used to instantiate the graphColour class which takes in the courses and date-venue combinations and uses a custom graph colouring algorithm to create an optimal timetable (if possible). For each match between a course and date-venue, an instance of a Slot is created. The dbInterface class is then used again to store the slots in the database as a Timetable table which allows the presentation layer to display it and perform operations on it for all relevant users.

The class diagram as presented above is the final output of the design process discussed above. The
implementation of the system is drawn from the class diagram. The system depicted by the class diagram
is discussed in section 4.

\subsection{Pair I - Front End}

The front end pair are responsible for the design of the presentation layer. This entails creating mock-ups (wireframes) of the relevant screens. Thereafter, the screens are turned into an actual interface design which includes all of the necessary components. Once the interface deign is in place, the logic to make it work and receive user requests is designed and checked to ensure it will successfully satisfy both the functional and non-functional requirements aspects relating to it. After all of the above work has been completed, the front end is designed and ready for the implementation phase of the project, discussed below.

\subsection{Pair II - Back End}

The back end pair are responsible for both the business and data layers of the SchedEx system. The business layer involves the creation of a class diagram - through the translation of requirements and use cases to a design that may be implemented in code - which provides a detailed description of the attributes and methods in each class of the object oriented solution. The data layer entails the consideration of various aspects (such as security, data types and querying) which leads to the selection of an appropriate solution and the creation of an entity relationship diagram which provides insight into the relational database, the various tables, attributes, primary and foreign keys and the relationships between each of the entities. After this above work has been accomplished, the back end is fully designed and ready for the implementation phase of the project, discussed below.

\section{System Implementation}
The implementation of the above design is split up into three distinct sections, namely the Presentation,
Business and Data Layers.

\section{SCRUM Sprints}

\subsection{Project Sprint Planning}
\subsubsection{Team}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Project Owner - the project owner was determined to be the lecturer and his instructions
would come from emails, consultations and project brief.
\item Scrum Master - the Team Lead (Harvey Muyangayanga) also assumed the role of SCRUM
master, insuring that the due dates are kept and that the sprints are completed.
\item Development Team - the team of four students was split into two pairs: Front-end and Back-end.
The front-end team includes Harvey Muyangayanga (941446) and Zaeem Nalla (1178454). The back-end team includes Jason Parry (1046955) and Uvir Bhagirathi (1141886).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sprint}
It was decided that the project will run over four sprints and each of them will have a duration of roughly two weeks. This however varies depending on due dates.\\
Sprint 1 was scheduled to run from the 10th of August to the 24th of August.\\
Sprint 2 was scheduled to run from the 25th of August to the 1st of September\\
Sprint 3 was scheduled to run from the 4th of September to the 18th of September\\
Sprint 4 was scheduled to run from the 18th of September to the 2nd of October\\

\subsubsection{Stand Ups}
Stand up meetings were held on Mondays for a period of fifteen minutes and were replaced on the other days of the week by video conferences, Slack messages and emails to keep everyone updated according to their availability.

\section{Conclusion}
The above document details the design and implementation of a web application which schedules college/university examinations. Requirements gathering has been undertaken to determine the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. A design has been drawn up using UML models as well as logical splitting of the design into various layers. This design is implemented as a web application which, when tested, adheres to the specifications that were determined during the requirements gathering process. Finally, a detailed description of the agile SCRUM process followed by the development team is provided through sprint planning and a sprint retrospective.
