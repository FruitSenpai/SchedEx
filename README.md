# SchedEx

We advise that you first clone the repository with the terminal command ***git clone https://github.com/FruitSenpai/SchedEx.git***, or download the zip file of the repository and then extract it. The starting point of the system is the login page located at front-end/src/login/login.html. This page asks for login credentials (i.e. email and password) since different features are available for the different types of users (i.e. student, lecturer, coordinator, administrator). In order to have a look at the different views, enter the following details for the user view you would like to have a look at (lecturer credentials have been omitted since their available features are identical to students, therefore it's essentially the same view):

| User View     | Email                | Password    |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Student       | student@uni.ac.za    | student     |
| Coordinator   | coodinator@uni.ac.za | coordinator |
| Administrator | admin@uni.ac.za      | admin       |
